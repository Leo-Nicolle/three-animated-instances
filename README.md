# three-animated-instances

This project just shows how to create isntances of THREE SkinnedMesh and animate them.

[Check it out in action](https://leo-nicolle.github.io/three-animated-instances/)

## Project setup

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Contributing

This is a nice start but something CRUCIAL is missing: beeing able to animate each instance separatly.
Any idea on which should be the best approach?

## Credits

The model used is [CesiumMan](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/CesiumMan) from GTL samples files.
